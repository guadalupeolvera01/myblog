        <h1> Welcome to my blog</h1>
        <p>Hello Fellow Curious stranger, you ever wondered what it's like living in NYC?</p>
        <p>Well, I will tell you about it and I will also show you some of my photography. I am not a photographer but once I see something I like for instance a view of buildings or the sky I take a picture of it. Yes, it may seem annoying that sometimes people take a lot of pictures of everywhere they go but it's good to understand that some people just want to keep a picture of it as a memory they want to keep.</p>

      <h1>What is it like living in New York City?</h1>
  <p>First I will start off with the Cons:
      
     Living in NYC  is very interesting but expensive. It's not easy finding an entire apartment that's affordable enough for 2 hard working people. Specially when you live in such beautiful areas like Astoria, Queens or even near Tribeca. In order to really be able to afford an entire apartmemt you would most likely have to work 2 jobs and work everyday non-stop at least for lower income folks and maybe middle class as well. But on the bright side there is always renting incase you ever need a little help for rent and even utilities.</p>
      
      <p>Second the Pros: NYC is very full of culture and diversity. You get these amazing views and a bunch of opportunities to do better in life. There is a lot of education opportunities and possibly chances to work it just depends on where you look and who you network with. It's always good to have connections because you may never know when you will need help. NYC is full of amazing views specially in places like Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>
